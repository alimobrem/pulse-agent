## The Origin Story

On **March 9, 2026**, the [first commit](https://github.com/alimobrem/OpenshiftPulse/commit/3736449) landed in what was then called **ShiftOps** — a React/TypeScript frontend for browsing OpenShift clusters. It used React 19, Rspack, and Vitest. The initial vision was straightforward: a modern, fast alternative to the OpenShift Console with better UX.

Two weeks later, on **March 24**, the agent backend got its first commit. The idea had expanded: what if the cluster browser wasn't just a dashboard, but had an AI copilot that could actually diagnose and fix problems?

By the end of April, Pulse had become something neither repo was designed to be on day one — a full AI-powered SRE platform with 136 tools, 7 skills, 22 scanners, and an autonomous monitor that could find, diagnose, and fix cluster issues without human intervention.

This is the story of how that happened — the decisions, the mistakes, and the things we'd do differently.

## Timeline

### Phase 0: The Console (March 9 – March 23)

**What we built:** A cluster management UI with 13 views, 1,128 tests, and full RBAC support.

The frontend started as a clean-sheet OpenShift Console replacement. Key milestones from this period:

- **[v1.0.0](https://github.com/alimobrem/OpenshiftPulse/releases/tag/v1.0.0)** (Mar 12) — Dark mode, basic resource browser, cost dashboard
- **[v2.0.0](https://github.com/alimobrem/OpenshiftPulse/releases/tag/v2.0.0)** (Mar 12) — Runbook automation framework
- **[v3.0.0](https://github.com/alimobrem/OpenshiftPulse/releases/tag/v3.0.0)** (Mar 18) — Renamed from ShiftOps to **OpenShift Pulse**. The name change reflected a shift in vision — we weren't just building a console, we were building something that could feel the cluster's "pulse."
- **[v4.0.0](https://github.com/alimobrem/OpenshiftPulse/releases/tag/v4.0.0)** (Mar 19) — HyperShift/Hosted Control Plane support ([changelog entry](https://github.com/alimobrem/OpenshiftPulse/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md)). This was a design decision that paid off: every feature from day one had to work on both traditional and hosted clusters. We detected `controlPlaneTopology: External` from the Infrastructure resource and adapted health checks, compute views, and production readiness scoring.

**Design decisions that stuck:**

- Rspack over Webpack. Build time: ~1 second. Never regretted this.
- Zustand over Redux. Simpler mental model, less boilerplate.
- Tailwind CSS from the start. Controversial for an OpenShift-adjacent project (PatternFly is the standard), but it gave us the speed to iterate on UI daily.

**First big mistake:** We originally used PatternFly components and spent a week fighting with their opinionated CSS. Ripping it out and going Tailwind + Radix UI was painful but freed us to build faster.

### Phase 1: The Agent is Born (March 24 – March 27)

**What we built:** An AI SRE agent with 54 tools, WebSocket streaming, and an autonomous monitor.

This was the most intense period. In four days:

- **[v1.0.0](https://github.com/alimobrem/pulse-agent/releases/tag/v1.0.0)** (Mar 25, `[7a81ab0](https://github.com/alimobrem/pulse-agent/commit/7a81ab0)`) — Initial agent release. SRE mode with 39 read tools, 9 write tools, security scanner with 9 tools. CLI and WebSocket API.
- **[v1.1.0](https://github.com/alimobrem/pulse-agent/releases/tag/v1.1.0)** (Mar 26, `[ec01951](https://github.com/alimobrem/pulse-agent/commit/ec01951)`) — Structured error handling with `ToolError` classification (7 categories). See `[sre_agent/errors.py](../sre_agent/errors.py)`.
- **[v1.2.0](https://github.com/alimobrem/pulse-agent/releases/tag/v1.2.0)** (Mar 26, `[98dcd21](https://github.com/alimobrem/pulse-agent/commit/98dcd21)`) — Speed and reliability pass. We realized every K8s API call needed to be wrapped in `safe()` — a function that catches exceptions and returns error strings instead of crashing the agent loop. See `[sre_agent/k8s_client.py](../sre_agent/k8s_client.py)`.
- **[v1.3.0](https://github.com/alimobrem/pulse-agent/releases/tag/v1.3.0)** (Mar 26, `[70ba2f2](https://github.com/alimobrem/pulse-agent/commit/70ba2f2)`) — Deploy pipeline. First time shipping to a real cluster.
- **[v1.4.0](https://github.com/alimobrem/pulse-agent/releases/tag/v1.4.0)** (Mar 26, `[b1d6a87](https://github.com/alimobrem/pulse-agent/commit/b1d6a87)`) — **Protocol v2.** The original protocol was request-response over HTTP. We rewrote it as a WebSocket streaming protocol with separate endpoints for interactive (`/ws/agent`) and autonomous (`/ws/monitor`) modes. This was the right call — streaming thinking indicators, tool execution badges, and component specs all needed push-based delivery. Full protocol spec: `[API_CONTRACT.md](../API_CONTRACT.md)`.
- **[v1.5.0](https://github.com/alimobrem/pulse-agent/releases/tag/v1.5.0)** (Mar 27, `[db36131](https://github.com/alimobrem/pulse-agent/commit/db36131)`) — Autonomous monitor with 16 scanners and auto-fix at trust level 3+. See `[SECURITY.md](../SECURITY.md)` for trust level definitions.

**The "Four Pillars" that got cut:** The v0.2.0 prototype had four experimental features — ArgoCD integration, "Time Machine" (cluster state replay), Git PR proposals, and Prophet-based predictions. All four were cut or heavily reworked. Time Machine was too expensive (snapshotting full cluster state every minute). Prophet predictions were unreliable without enough historical data. We kept ArgoCD and Git PRs but rebuilt them from scratch later.

**Critical bug:** The agent loop used `asyncio.to_thread()` for LLM streaming, which is wrong — the Anthropic async client already runs on the event loop. This caused thread safety issues that manifested as garbled streaming output. We fixed it by switching to `AsyncAnthropic` with native `async with`/`async for`. See the [async migration spec](superpowers/specs/2026-04-23-async-anthropic-migration-design.md) and [implementation plan](superpowers/plans/2026-04-23-async-anthropic-migration.md) for the full technical story (commit `[1ceae75](https://github.com/alimobrem/pulse-agent/commit/1ceae75)`).

**Security wake-up call:** The first deploy to a real cluster revealed that our Helm chart had a wildcard RBAC rule (`patch */`*). A sysadmin-customer review agent caught this, and we replaced it with scoped rules for specific API groups. We also discovered SSRF vulnerabilities in the dev proxy (IPv6 bypass), CRLF injection in user impersonation headers, and a 1MB WebSocket message limit that was missing entirely. All fixed before v1.0 shipped. Full security model documented in `[SECURITY.md](../SECURITY.md)`.

### Phase 2: Making It Smart (March 27 – April 1)

**What we built:** Self-improving memory, PromQL recipes, generative views, Pydantic config.

- **[v1.5.1](https://github.com/alimobrem/pulse-agent/releases/tag/v1.5.1)** (Mar 27, `[5e4fc88](https://github.com/alimobrem/pulse-agent/commit/5e4fc88)`) — Eval gating. We built a test suite of real-world SRE prompts and blocked releases that regressed scores. This caught dozens of prompt regressions over the next month. See `[TESTING.md](../TESTING.md)` and `[sre_agent/evals/README.md](../sre_agent/evals/README.md)`.
- **[v1.6.0](https://github.com/alimobrem/pulse-agent/releases/tag/v1.6.0)** (Mar 29, `[056a158](https://github.com/alimobrem/pulse-agent/commit/056a158)`) — Memory system with PostgreSQL persistence. The agent could now learn from past incidents — patterns detected, runbooks discovered, feedback incorporated. See `[sre_agent/memory/](../sre_agent/memory/)`.
- **[v1.7.0](https://github.com/alimobrem/pulse-agent/releases/tag/v1.7.0)** (Mar 29, `[1252220](https://github.com/alimobrem/pulse-agent/commit/1252220)`) — Morning briefing and noise learning. The monitor would greet users with a summary of overnight activity. Noise learning tracked transient findings (pods that crashloop once then recover) and suppressed them with a configurable `PULSE_AGENT_NOISE_THRESHOLD`.
- **[v1.8.0](https://github.com/alimobrem/pulse-agent/releases/tag/v1.8.0)** (Mar 29, `[03e136c](https://github.com/alimobrem/pulse-agent/commit/03e136c)`) — User preferences and rollback support.
- **[v1.9.0](https://github.com/alimobrem/pulse-agent/releases/tag/v1.9.0)** (Mar 29, `[56afb9b](https://github.com/alimobrem/pulse-agent/commit/56afb9b)`) — Auth audit scanner. Five new scanners for config changes, RBAC mutations, deployments, warning events, and auth failures.
- **[v1.10.0](https://github.com/alimobrem/pulse-agent/releases/tag/v1.10.0)** (Mar 31, `[5a310d0](https://github.com/alimobrem/pulse-agent/commit/5a310d0)`) — **Generative views.** The agent could now create interactive dashboards from natural language. "Show me a dashboard for namespace monitoring" would produce a real, saved, interactive view with charts and tables. See `[sre_agent/view_tools.py](../sre_agent/view_tools.py)`.
- **[v1.13.0](https://github.com/alimobrem/pulse-agent/releases/tag/v1.13.0)** (Apr 1, `[e10a432](https://github.com/alimobrem/pulse-agent/commit/e10a432)`) — Infrastructure hardening. PostgreSQL-only (dropped SQLite for production), connection pooling, schema migration system, generic K8s resource tools. See `[DATABASE.md](../DATABASE.md)` for the full schema.

**The PostgreSQL SERIAL saga** ([v1.5.2](https://github.com/alimobrem/pulse-agent/releases/tag/v1.5.2) – [v1.5.3](https://github.com/alimobrem/pulse-agent/releases/tag/v1.5.3), commits `[74fe72e](https://github.com/alimobrem/pulse-agent/commit/74fe72e)` and `[fa853aa](https://github.com/alimobrem/pulse-agent/commit/fa853aa)`): We shipped two patch releases to fix `SERIAL` column handling. The bug: our migration code used `SERIAL PRIMARY KEY` but the ORM was trying to insert explicit `id` values, causing duplicate key violations (commit `[15e7dfb](https://github.com/alimobrem/pulse-agent/commit/15e7dfb)`). The fix was small but the debugging was painful because the error only appeared after the database had enough rows to trigger the conflict.

**The `os.environ` purge:** v1.15.0 migrated all ~30 raw `os.environ.get()` calls to a centralized Pydantic `PulseAgentSettings` model with `PULSE_AGENT`_ prefix. See `[sre_agent/config.py](../sre_agent/config.py)`. This caught several bugs — missing defaults, wrong types, and one case where `PULSE_AGENT_TOKEN_FORWARDING` was read as a string `"false"` which is truthy in Python. Pydantic caught it as a bool.

**View designer iteration hell:** The generative view system went through 11 documented pitfalls (see below in "Mistakes"). Design specs: [data-first generative UI](superpowers/specs/2026-04-04-data-first-generative-ui-design.md) and [view designer tuning](superpowers/specs/2026-04-04-view-designer-tuning-design.md).

### Phase 3: Architecture at Scale (April 1 – April 12)

**What we built:** Skill system, MCP integration, tool analytics, modular architecture, eval infrastructure.

This phase was about taking a working prototype and making it maintainable and extensible.

- **[v1.14.0](https://github.com/alimobrem/pulse-agent/releases/tag/v1.14.0)** (Apr 7, `[1adb2e7](https://github.com/alimobrem/pulse-agent/commit/1adb2e7)`) — Tool analytics and semantic layout engine. We built a full audit log for tool usage, discovered tool calling patterns via bigram analysis, and replaced 5 fixed dashboard templates with a role-based auto-layout engine. Specs: [tool chain intelligence](superpowers/specs/2026-04-03-tool-chain-intelligence-design.md), [tool usage tracking](superpowers/specs/2026-04-03-tool-usage-tracking-design.md), [semantic layout engine](superpowers/specs/2026-04-04-semantic-layout-engine-design.md). Plans: [tool tracking prereqs](superpowers/plans/2026-04-03-tool-tracking-prereqs.md), [tool usage backend](superpowers/plans/2026-04-03-tool-usage-backend.md), [tool usage frontend](superpowers/plans/2026-04-03-tool-usage-frontend.md).
- **[v1.15.0](https://github.com/alimobrem/pulse-agent/releases/tag/v1.15.0)** (Apr 9, `[bd70030](https://github.com/alimobrem/pulse-agent/commit/bd70030)`) — **The Great Split.** Three files had grown too large: `k8s_tools.py` (4,419 lines), `monitor.py` (2,486 lines), `api_routes.py` (2,415 lines). We split them into packages — `k8s_tools/` (11 modules), `monitor/` (10 modules), `api/` (12 modules). After the split, no file exceeded 910 lines. All backward-compatible imports preserved. Key commits: `[a739819](https://github.com/alimobrem/pulse-agent/commit/a739819)` (monitor split), `[401ba0d](https://github.com/alimobrem/pulse-agent/commit/401ba0d)` (cleanup).
- **[v1.16.0](https://github.com/alimobrem/pulse-agent/releases/tag/v1.16.0)** (Apr 9, `[18f4b89](https://github.com/alimobrem/pulse-agent/commit/18f4b89)`) — Eval comparison infrastructure. A/B baseline diffing, prompt token auditing, and section ablation testing. Spec: [prompt optimization](superpowers/specs/2026-04-09-prompt-optimization-design.md). We could now measure the impact of removing any section from the system prompt.
- **[v2.0.0](https://github.com/alimobrem/pulse-agent/releases/tag/v2.0.0)** (Apr 12, `[b638935](https://github.com/alimobrem/pulse-agent/commit/b638935)`) — **Extensible skill system and MCP integration.** Skills were drop-in `.md` files that defined routing rules, tool selections, component hints, and eval scenarios. MCP integration added 36 tools from the OpenShift MCP server. The Toolbox UI consolidated everything into a single page. Spec: [extensible agent architecture](superpowers/specs/2026-04-10-extensible-agent-architecture-design.md). Skill developer guide: `[docs/SKILL_DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md](SKILL_DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md)`. Skill definitions: `[sre_agent/skills/](../sre_agent/skills/)`.

**The prompt optimization breakthrough:** v1.14.0 reduced the SRE system prompt from 28KB to 8KB — a 71% reduction. We did this by making component schemas and runbook injection dynamic (only included when relevant to the query). Combined with `cache_control: ephemeral` on the system prompt, this cut API costs by ~90%. See `[sre_agent/harness.py](../sre_agent/harness.py)` and `[sre_agent/skill_loader.py](../sre_agent/skill_loader.py)`.

**Typo correction saves the day:** We built a dictionary of ~130 common K8s/SRE misspellings (commit `[f9e5911](https://github.com/alimobrem/pulse-agent/commit/f9e5911)` and `[d7a1caf](https://github.com/alimobrem/pulse-agent/commit/d7a1caf)`) with automatic plural/suffix handling. This sounds trivial but dramatically improved routing accuracy — misspelled queries were hitting the wrong skill or returning no results. One subtle bug: typo correction initially ran *after* the hard pre-route regex rules, so a misspelled keyword wouldn't match the regex. We fixed it (commit `[339d5bc](https://github.com/alimobrem/pulse-agent/commit/339d5bc)`) to run **hard pre-route before typo correction** — the regex rules are more reliable and shouldn't be undermined by the correction algorithm. This took two routing eval failures to catch.

### Phase 4: Intelligence (April 12 – April 17)

**What we built:** ORCA routing, adaptive tool selection, Mission Control, plan runtime, SLO registry, postmortems.

- **[v2.1.0](https://github.com/alimobrem/pulse-agent/releases/tag/v2.1.0)** (Apr 12, `[1980d49](https://github.com/alimobrem/pulse-agent/commit/1980d49)`) — Mission Control analytics with Vertex AI cost tracking. Specs: [Mission Control redesign](superpowers/specs/2026-04-12-mission-control-redesign-design.md). Plans: [backend](superpowers/plans/2026-04-12-mission-control-backend.md), [frontend](superpowers/plans/2026-04-12-mission-control-frontend.md).
- **[v2.2.0](https://github.com/alimobrem/pulse-agent/releases/tag/v2.2.0)** (Apr 12, `[6519218](https://github.com/alimobrem/pulse-agent/commit/6519218)`) — **Adaptive tool selection engine.** TF-IDF prediction learned which tools were relevant for each query from real usage. An LLM fallback (Haiku) handled cold start. Co-occurrence bundles tracked tools called together. Negative signals actively suppressed tools that were offered but never used. The result: `ALWAYS_INCLUDE` dropped from 12 tools to 5. Spec: [adaptive tool selection](superpowers/specs/2026-04-12-adaptive-tool-selection-design.md). Plan: [implementation](superpowers/plans/2026-04-12-adaptive-tool-selection.md). Key file: `[sre_agent/tool_predictor.py](../sre_agent/tool_predictor.py)`.
- **[v2.3.0](https://github.com/alimobrem/pulse-agent/releases/tag/v2.3.0)** (Apr 14, `[b1a14ba](https://github.com/alimobrem/pulse-agent/commit/b1a14ba)`) — **ORCA multi-signal skill selector.** 6-channel fusion (keyword, temporal, memory, entity, feedback, LLM), bidirectional `conflicts_with` for skills that shouldn't run together, exclusive skills that bypass secondary selection, and parallel multi-skill execution (max 2 concurrent skills with Sonnet-powered synthesis). Key commits: ORCA wiring (`[c1ccad4](https://github.com/alimobrem/pulse-agent/commit/c1ccad4)`), plan templates (`[6076d70](https://github.com/alimobrem/pulse-agent/commit/6076d70)`), plan runtime (`[b69889c](https://github.com/alimobrem/pulse-agent/commit/b69889c)`), SLO registry (`[36614a3](https://github.com/alimobrem/pulse-agent/commit/36614a3)`), postmortem generation (`[5a3d311](https://github.com/alimobrem/pulse-agent/commit/5a3d311)`). Parallel multi-skill spec: [design](superpowers/specs/2026-04-19-parallel-multi-skill-execution-design.md), [plan](superpowers/plans/2026-04-19-parallel-multi-skill-execution.md). Key files: `[sre_agent/skill_router.py](../sre_agent/skill_router.py)`, `[sre_agent/synthesis.py](../sre_agent/synthesis.py)`.
- **[v2.4.0](https://github.com/alimobrem/pulse-agent/releases/tag/v2.4.0)** (Apr 17, `[98288c5](https://github.com/alimobrem/pulse-agent/commit/98288c5)`) — Live tables with K8s watches + PromQL metrics + log enrichment. Topology graph with 5 perspectives (Physical, Logical, Network, Multi-Tenant, Helm). 55/55 routing accuracy on the eval suite. Topology spec: [perspectives design](superpowers/specs/2026-04-19-topology-perspectives-design.md), [plan](superpowers/plans/2026-04-19-topology-perspectives.md). Key files: `[sre_agent/dependency_graph.py](../sre_agent/dependency_graph.py)`, `[sre_agent/k8s_tools/live_table.py](../sre_agent/k8s_tools/live_table.py)`.

**The ORCA evolution:** Skill routing went through three generations:

1. **Keyword matching** (v1.0) — simple regex in `[sre_agent/orchestrator.py](../sre_agent/orchestrator.py)`. Worked for obvious queries, failed on ambiguous ones like "create a capacity planning dashboard" (routes to capacity_planner, should route to view_designer).
2. **LLM classification** (v2.0) — used Haiku for intent classification. More accurate but added 200ms latency and API cost to every query.
3. **ORCA 6-channel fusion** (v2.3) — keyword scoring, temporal context (what skill was used recently), memory patterns, entity detection, feedback signals, and LLM as a tiebreaker. Zero-cost for clear queries (keyword match is definitive), LLM only invoked when channels disagree. Eval framework: `[a0dee88](https://github.com/alimobrem/pulse-agent/commit/a0dee88)` (23 routing scenarios).

**The pre-route handoff fix:** A subtle routing bug: "create a capacity planning dashboard" matched `capacity_planner` on keywords, but the user's *intent* was to create a *dashboard* (view_designer). We added `handoff_to` rules in skill definitions — if the keyword winner's handoff rules match the query, route to the handoff target instead. This required the handoff check to happen during routing, not after.

**Intelligent auto-fix:** The monitor originally fixed crashlooping pods by deleting them (letting the controller recreate). This is a blunt instrument — if the pod is crashlooping because of a bad image or missing config, deleting it just creates a new crashlooping pod. v2.2.0 added a fix planner that classifies root cause (bad_image, oom, missing_config, probe_failure, quota_exceeded, crash_exit, dependency) and selects a targeted strategy (patch_image, patch_resources). Blunt restarts were disabled entirely. Only targeted fixes with confidence >= 0.5 execute. Spec: [autonomous remediation](superpowers/specs/2026-04-17-autonomous-remediation-design.md). Plan: [intelligent autofix](superpowers/plans/2026-04-13-intelligent-autofix.md). Also: autofix eval suite (`[933f093](https://github.com/alimobrem/pulse-agent/commit/933f093)`).

### Phase 5: The Platform (April 17 – April 25)

**What we built:** Ops Inbox, investigation views, user token forwarding, async migration, security hardening.

- **[v2.5.0](https://github.com/alimobrem/pulse-agent/releases/tag/v2.5.0)** (Apr 20, `[e18cc40](https://github.com/alimobrem/pulse-agent/commit/e18cc40)`) — Next-gen phases 1-6 complete. View lifecycle with 3 view types (incident/plan/assessment), multi-user claims, finding dedup, recurrence handling, assessment-to-incident escalation. ViewEventBus for real-time broadcast. Performance tests and operational metrics endpoints. Full revised spec: [next-gen revised design](superpowers/specs/2026-04-20-nextgen-revised-design.md). Phase plans: [phase 1](superpowers/plans/2026-04-20-nextgen-phase1-cleanup.md), [phase 2](superpowers/plans/2026-04-20-phase2-view-components.md), [phase 3a](superpowers/plans/2026-04-20-phase3a-view-schema.md), [phase 3b](superpowers/plans/2026-04-20-phase3b-agent-auto-creation.md).

**Post-v2.5.0** (Apr 20-25) — 80+ commits:

- **Ops Inbox:** 13 proactive task generators (cert expiry, trend prediction, degraded operators, SLO burn, capacity, RBAC drift, etc.), 13 REST endpoints, full frontend with lifecycle transitions, WebSocket live updates. Specs: [v1](superpowers/specs/2026-04-20-ops-inbox-design.md), [v2](superpowers/specs/2026-04-21-ops-inbox-design.md). Plan: [implementation](superpowers/plans/2026-04-21-ops-inbox.md). Key files: `[sre_agent/inbox.py](../sre_agent/inbox.py)`, `[sre_agent/inbox_generators.py](../sre_agent/inbox_generators.py)`, `[sre_agent/api/inbox_rest.py](../sre_agent/api/inbox_rest.py)`.
- **User token forwarding:** All K8s API calls now use the user's OAuth token from `X-Forwarded-Access-Token`. Monitor scans stay on the ServiceAccount. We chose direct token forwarding over impersonation because OpenShift RBAC is heavily group-based — impersonation drops group permissions. Spec: [design](superpowers/specs/2026-04-22-user-token-forwarding-design.md). Plan: [implementation](superpowers/plans/2026-04-22-user-token-forwarding.md). Key commits: `[708db96](https://github.com/alimobrem/pulse-agent/commit/708db96)`, `[6a536be](https://github.com/alimobrem/pulse-agent/commit/6a536be)`.
- **Async Anthropic migration:** Moved the entire agent loop from sync `Anthropic()` to `AsyncAnthropic()`. The LLM streaming now runs natively on the event loop. Tool execution stays sync in `ThreadPoolExecutor` (the K8s Python client is synchronous). Spec: [design](superpowers/specs/2026-04-23-async-anthropic-migration-design.md). Plan: [implementation](superpowers/plans/2026-04-23-async-anthropic-migration.md). Commit: `[1ceae75](https://github.com/alimobrem/pulse-agent/commit/1ceae75)`.
- **Security fixes:** IDOR vulnerabilities in view endpoints, HMAC-based token comparison, ReDoS in input validation regex. See `[SECURITY.md](../SECURITY.md)`.
- **SRE prompt rewrite:** The system prompt was rewritten to emphasize "diagnose fast, act decisively" — the agent was being too cautious, requesting dry-runs before every action. The new prompt has a 5-tool-call budget for diagnosis before it must commit to a fix. Commits: `[ea6411a](https://github.com/alimobrem/pulse-agent/commit/ea6411a)`, `[c86d03e](https://github.com/alimobrem/pulse-agent/commit/c86d03e)`.
- **Investigation views:** Views auto-created from monitor findings. Spec: [design](superpowers/specs/2026-04-22-investigation-view-plan-design.md). Plan: [implementation](superpowers/plans/2026-04-22-investigation-view-plan.md).

## Design Decisions and Why We Made Them

### 1. WebSocket over REST for agent communication

**Decision:** Use WebSocket streaming for all agent interactions instead of REST.

**Why:** The agent loop is inherently streaming — thinking indicators, partial text, tool execution progress, component specs, and confirmation gates all need push-based delivery. A REST endpoint would need polling, which adds latency and complexity.

**Trade-off:** WebSocket connections are stateful and harder to load-balance. We accepted this because each agent session is already stateful (conversation history).

**Ref:** [API_CONTRACT.md](../API_CONTRACT.md), `[sre_agent/api/ws_endpoints.py](../sre_agent/api/ws_endpoints.py)`

### 2. Protocol v2: Separate endpoints for interactive and autonomous

**Decision:** `/ws/agent` for user-driven queries, `/ws/monitor` for autonomous scanning.

**Why:** The interactive agent needs confirmation gates, streaming UI, and user context. The monitor needs none of that — it runs unattended with configurable trust levels. Sharing an endpoint would mean every monitor scan negotiates confirmation gates it doesn't use.

### 3. Tool results return `(text, component_spec)` tuples

**Decision:** Tools return both a text description (for Claude to reason about) and a structured component spec (for the UI to render).

**Why:** Claude needs text to reason about results. Users need visual tables, charts, and status indicators. Separating the two means the LLM never sees HTML/JSON meant for the UI, and the UI never parses natural language meant for the LLM.

**Ref:** `[sre_agent/decorators.py](../sre_agent/decorators.py)`, `[sre_agent/component_registry.py](../sre_agent/component_registry.py)`, [data-first generative UI spec](superpowers/specs/2026-04-04-data-first-generative-ui-design.md)

### 4. Prompt caching with `cache_control: ephemeral`

**Decision:** Cache the system prompt across turns within a session.

**Why:** The system prompt (including runbooks, component hints, and cluster context) was 8KB+ even after optimization. Caching it saved ~90% on API costs. The `ephemeral` flag means it's only cached for the session — no stale prompts across deploys.

**Ref:** `[sre_agent/harness.py](../sre_agent/harness.py)`, [prompt optimization spec](superpowers/specs/2026-04-09-prompt-optimization-design.md)

### 5. PostgreSQL over SQLite for everything

**Decision:** v1.13.0 dropped SQLite and went PostgreSQL-only, even for the StatefulSet in-cluster.

**Why:** SQLite can't handle concurrent access from the agent loop, monitor scanner, and API endpoints. We hit WAL locking issues under load. PostgreSQL with connection pooling (`ThreadedConnectionPool`) handles concurrency natively. The cost: a StatefulSet with a PVC, but we needed persistent storage anyway.

**Ref:** `[DATABASE.md](../DATABASE.md)`, `[sre_agent/db.py](../sre_agent/db.py)`, `[chart/templates/postgresql.yaml](../chart/templates/postgresql.yaml)`

### 6. Pydantic Settings over raw `os.environ`

**Decision:** All configuration flows through `PulseAgentSettings(BaseSettings)` with `PULSE_AGENT`_ prefix.

**Why:** Type safety. `os.environ.get("PULSE_AGENT_TOKEN_FORWARDING", "true")` returns a string — `"false"` is truthy. Pydantic validates types at startup and fails loudly. We also got `.env` file support, default documentation, and IDE autocomplete for free.

**Ref:** `[sre_agent/config.py](../sre_agent/config.py)`, commit `[a7e4673](https://github.com/alimobrem/pulse-agent/commit/a7e4673)`

### 7. Skills as markdown files, not code

**Decision:** Skill definitions are `.md` files with YAML frontmatter, not Python modules.

**Why:** Users should be able to create skills through the chat interface without writing code. The agent can `create_skill` and `edit_skill` by writing markdown. Hot reload means no restart needed. The trade-off: skills can't define custom tool implementations (they can only select from existing tools).

**Ref:** [SKILL_DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md](SKILL_DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md), `[sre_agent/skill_loader.py](../sre_agent/skill_loader.py)`, [extensible architecture spec](superpowers/specs/2026-04-10-extensible-agent-architecture-design.md)

### 8. ORCA multi-signal routing over single-classifier

**Decision:** 6-channel fusion instead of a single LLM classifier for skill routing.

**Why:** A single classifier (even Haiku) adds 200ms and costs tokens on every query. ORCA's keyword channel resolves ~80% of queries at zero cost. The LLM channel only fires when other channels disagree. Parallel multi-skill execution (max 2) handles queries that genuinely span skills.

**Ref:** `[sre_agent/skill_router.py](../sre_agent/skill_router.py)`, `[sre_agent/selector_learning.py](../sre_agent/selector_learning.py)`, routing eval commit `[a0dee88](https://github.com/alimobrem/pulse-agent/commit/a0dee88)`

### 9. Direct token forwarding over impersonation

**Decision:** Forward the user's OAuth token to K8s API calls instead of using `Impersonate-User` headers.

**Why:** OpenShift RBAC is heavily group-based. Impersonation only copies user identity, not group membership. The user would lose permissions they have through group bindings. Direct token forwarding preserves the full identity.

**Ref:** [Token forwarding spec](superpowers/specs/2026-04-22-user-token-forwarding-design.md), `[sre_agent/k8s_client.py](../sre_agent/k8s_client.py)`

### 10. Conversational-first, visual-second, code-third

**Decision:** The primary interface is natural language chat. Visuals appear to confirm understanding. YAML/code only surfaces when explicitly requested.

**Why:** SREs spend their time in terminals and dashboards. We're not replacing those — we're adding a layer that understands intent. "Why is my app slow?" should produce a diagnosis with supporting charts, not a wall of YAML.

**Ref:** [DESIGN_PRINCIPLES.md](../DESIGN_PRINCIPLES.md)

## Mistakes We Made (and How We Fixed Them)

### 1. Silent exception swallowing

**The mistake:** Throughout the codebase, we had `except Exception: pass` blocks. This is standard defensive programming — catch errors, don't crash.

**The consequence:** During the Ops Inbox build, a Vertex AI client bug (`anthropic.Anthropic()` instead of `create_client()`) was hidden for an **entire session**. Every Claude API call failed, but the error handlers swallowed the exceptions silently. The triage pipeline appeared to work locally but produced no results. Three code review agents also missed it because the pattern looked "safe."

**The fix:** Banned `except Exception: pass` entirely. Every exception handler must call `logger.exception()`. Added pre-commit checks to flag bare `pass` in exception handlers.

**Lesson:** "Defensive programming" that hides errors is worse than crashing. At least a crash tells you something is wrong.

### 2. Dead-end UI states

**The mistake:** We shipped drawers and detail panels where certain statuses had no action buttons. An escalated inbox item would show its details but offer no way to do anything about it. An `agent_cleared` finding showed a green checkmark but no "restore" or "dismiss" button.

**The consequence:** The user caught this three separate times and had to ask for fixes each time. We checked the happy path but not all status variants.

**The fix:** Before committing any drawer/detail component, we now enumerate ALL possible values of `item.status` and verify each one renders at least one action button. If any status is missing buttons, the code is not done. Added a UX workflow reviewer agent (commit `[282afef](https://github.com/alimobrem/pulse-agent/commit/282afef)`) and lifecycle tests (commit `[66f3e12](https://github.com/alimobrem/pulse-agent/commit/66f3e12)`).

**Lesson:** UI completeness means every state, not just the common ones.

### 3. The view designer prompt engineering rabbit hole

**The mistake:** We spent multiple iterations trying to make the LLM produce perfect dashboards through prompt engineering alone. Rules like "ALWAYS call cluster_metrics() FIRST" and "NEVER forget time_range" were added to the system prompt.

**The consequence:** The LLM ignored the rules. Every dashboard had the same generic KPI row. Charts rendered as tables because `time_range` was omitted. Validation that blocked saves broke the agent loop (agent calls `create_dashboard`, gets success, then `critique_view` says "not found").

**The fix:** Code enforcement replaced prompt engineering. `verify_query` was removed from the view_designer tool list entirely (it was causing 8-14 Prometheus calls per dashboard, commit `[ad5c830](https://github.com/alimobrem/pulse-agent/commit/ad5c830)`). `time_range` defaults were set in code. Dashboard validation logs warnings but always saves. The generic `cluster_metrics` call was removed from the prompt. Full lessons documented in [view designer tuning spec](superpowers/specs/2026-04-04-view-designer-tuning-design.md).

**Lesson:** For structured output, code constraints beat prompt instructions every time. If you need the LLM to always do X, make X the default in code and let the LLM opt out, not opt in.

### 4. Recharts height collapse

**The mistake:** Charts in generated dashboards rendered as 0-height invisible elements. We used `flex-1` and `h-full` CSS on chart containers.

**The consequence:** Dashboards looked broken — empty white space where charts should be. The data was there, the queries worked, but nothing was visible.

**The fix:** Recharts' `ResponsiveContainer` needs an explicit pixel height, not a flex-based one. `react-grid-layout` cells don't propagate height to children. We switched to `style={{ height: 300 }}` and aligned `rowHeight` between backend (`[sre_agent/layout_engine.py](../sre_agent/layout_engine.py)`) and frontend (`generateDefaultLayout`).

**Lesson:** CSS layout assumptions don't hold inside grid layout libraries. Test visual rendering, not just data correctness.

### 5. Helm secret regeneration on every deploy

**The mistake:** The Helm chart used `randAlphaNum` to generate the WebSocket token and PostgreSQL password. This generates a new random value on every `helm template` / `helm upgrade`.

**The consequence:** Every deploy generated new credentials, breaking all active WebSocket connections and PostgreSQL authentication. The agent pod would restart with a new token while the nginx configmap still had the old one.

**The fix:** Used `lookup()` to check if a Secret already exists. If it does, reuse the existing value. Only generate a new one on fresh install. Also discovered a double-base64 bug: `lookup()` returns already-base64-encoded `.data` values, so running `b64enc` again double-encodes them. See `[chart/templates/_helpers.tpl](../chart/templates/_helpers.tpl)`.

**Lesson:** Helm's declarative model fights against stateful resources. Always use `lookup()` for secrets.

### 6. The Thanos/ACM compatibility gap

**The mistake:** All 73 PromQL recipes (see `[sre_agent/promql_recipes.py](../sre_agent/promql_recipes.py)`) were written and tested against vanilla OpenShift `prometheus-k8s`. We didn't test against ACM clusters that use Thanos.

**The consequence:** On an ACM cluster, queries with `on(instance) group_left(node) kube_node_info` joins returned 422 errors. Thanos adds external labels and federates metrics differently. Charts rendered NaN from null Prometheus data. The RBAC fix commit `[68a7ecf](https://github.com/alimobrem/pulse-agent/commit/68a7ecf)` added `cluster-monitoring-view` access but the Thanos query incompatibility remains.

**The fix:** Still a TODO. Options: detect Thanos and adjust queries automatically, add Thanos-compatible recipe variants, or query local Prometheus directly bypassing Thanos.

**Lesson:** Test against the actual deployment targets, not just dev environments.

### 7. The SRE prompt was too cautious

**The mistake:** The original SRE system prompt emphasized safety so heavily that the agent would request dry-runs before every action, ask for confirmation multiple times, and hedge its diagnoses with excessive caveats.

**The consequence:** Users felt the agent was slow and indecisive. "Just tell me what's wrong and fix it" was common feedback. The agent would take 10+ tool calls to diagnose what an experienced SRE would see in 2.

**The fix:** Rewrote the SRE prompt with a 5-tool-call budget for diagnosis. "Diagnose fast, act decisively, no dry-runs." Commits: `[ea6411a](https://github.com/alimobrem/pulse-agent/commit/ea6411a)`, `[c86d03e](https://github.com/alimobrem/pulse-agent/commit/c86d03e)`, `[7b2e08a](https://github.com/alimobrem/pulse-agent/commit/7b2e08a)`. The confirmation gate in code (not in the prompt) is the safety mechanism — the prompt doesn't need to be cautious because the code enforces approval for writes.

**Lesson:** Safety mechanisms belong in code, not in prompts. A cautious prompt on top of a code-enforced confirmation gate is redundant and makes the agent worse.

### 8. The MCP field manager conflict

**The mistake:** The toolset toggle API patched the MCP deployment via the K8s API using the default field manager. Helm uses server-side apply with its own field manager.

**The consequence:** After toggling a toolset from the UI, the next `helm upgrade` failed with "conflict with OpenAPI-Generator" because two field managers owned the same fields. The only fix was deleting the deployment and letting Helm recreate it.

**The fix:** All K8s API patches now use `field_manager="helm"` to match Helm's ownership. Commits: `[2e0d49e](https://github.com/alimobrem/pulse-agent/commit/2e0d49e)`, `[8cbc08b](https://github.com/alimobrem/pulse-agent/commit/8cbc08b)`, `[8ec6610](https://github.com/alimobrem/pulse-agent/commit/8ec6610)`.

**Lesson:** Never patch Helm-managed resources with a different field manager. If you need runtime mutation of Helm-managed resources, coordinate through Helm's field manager.

### 9. Thread safety in the agent loop

**The mistake:** The early agent loop used `asyncio.to_thread()` to dispatch LLM streaming, assuming the Anthropic client was synchronous.

**The consequence:** The `AsyncAnthropic` client was already async. Wrapping it in `to_thread()` created a second event loop inside a thread, causing race conditions in streaming output — garbled text, out-of-order tokens, and occasional hangs.

**The fix:** Removed `to_thread()` entirely. LLM streaming runs on the main event loop with `async with`/`async for`. Tool execution stays sync in `ThreadPoolExecutor` because the K8s Python client is synchronous. See [async migration spec](superpowers/specs/2026-04-23-async-anthropic-migration-design.md) and commit `[1ceae75](https://github.com/alimobrem/pulse-agent/commit/1ceae75)`.

**Lesson:** Know your client library's async model before wrapping it.

### 10. Scrollbar CSS specificity wars

**The mistake:** We added `scrollbar-color` (standard CSS) alongside `::-webkit-scrollbar` pseudo-elements for custom scrollbar styling. See the [v2.4.1 changelog](https://github.com/alimobrem/OpenshiftPulse/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).

**The consequence:** Chrome 121+ ignores `::-webkit-scrollbar` when standard scrollbar properties are set (even via inheritance). Our custom 6px violet scrollbars reverted to 15px gray default scrollbars. This took hours to debug because the CSS looked correct and worked in older Chrome versions.

**The fix:** Removed all `scrollbar-color` and `scrollbar-width` properties. Used ONLY `::-webkit-scrollbar` pseudo-elements. Added a note in [CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md) ("Frontend CSS Gotchas" section) so this doesn't happen again.

**Lesson:** CSS feature detection is not just about support — it's about interaction between old and new specifications.

### 11. Startup probe timing

**The mistake:** The Helm chart's startup probe had `initialDelaySeconds: 5` for the agent container.

**The consequence:** The agent loads 7 skill packages, connects to K8s and PostgreSQL, then starts the HTTP server — this takes ~10s. The probe would fire before uvicorn was listening, causing transient "connection refused" warnings on every deploy. Commit `[c2135f8](https://github.com/alimobrem/pulse-agent/commit/c2135f8)`.

**The fix:** Increased `initialDelaySeconds` to 15. Added a similar fix for PostgreSQL (commit `[05bf955](https://github.com/alimobrem/pulse-agent/commit/05bf955)`).

**Lesson:** Startup probes need to account for application initialization time, not just container startup.

## The AI-Assisted Development Story

This project was built almost entirely with AI assistance (Claude Code / Claude Opus). Some observations from the experience:

**What worked well:**

- **Spec-driven development.** We wrote [23 design specs](superpowers/specs/) and [23 implementation plans](superpowers/plans/). Claude executed against these plans with high fidelity. The specs served as both documentation and development instructions.
- **Eval-gated releases.** The eval suite (see [TESTING.md](../TESTING.md)) caught regressions that manual testing would have missed. Every prompt change was tested against 175 scenarios.
- **Memory files as institutional knowledge.** The 35 memory files captured every hard-won lesson. Each new session started with full context of past mistakes and decisions.
- **Parallel agent work.** Using worktrees and parallel agents for independent tasks (e.g., frontend component + backend endpoint) saved significant time.
- **8 specialized Claude Code agents** (see `[.claude/agents/](../.claude/agents/)`) — tool-writer, runbook-writer, protocol-checker, tool-auditor, memory-auditor, security-hardener, test-writer, deploy-validator — each with focused expertise and hooks in `[.claude/settings.json](../.claude/settings.json)`.

**What didn't work:**

- **Prompt-only behavior control.** As documented in the [view designer tuning spec](superpowers/specs/2026-04-04-view-designer-tuning-design.md), telling the LLM "ALWAYS do X" in the system prompt is unreliable. Code enforcement is the only reliable mechanism.
- **Silent failures from defensive coding.** Three code review agents missed the `except: pass` bug because it looked like correct defensive programming. AI reviewers need to be specifically instructed to flag this pattern.
- **UI dead-ends.** The AI consistently tested the happy path but missed edge-case UI states. We learned to explicitly enumerate all status variants before shipping.
- **CSS visual issues.** AI can write correct CSS that renders incorrectly due to library-specific quirks (Recharts height, scrollbar specificity). Visual testing in a real browser is non-negotiable.

## What We Can Do Next

### Near-Term (Weeks)

1. **Thanos/ACM compatibility** — Auto-detect Thanos and provide compatible PromQL variants. This is a real gap blocking ACM cluster deployments. See `[sre_agent/promql_recipes.py](../sre_agent/promql_recipes.py)`.
2. **MCP server token forwarding** — The MCP server fork needs changes to consume the `Authorization` header from the agent. Currently MCP tools run with the ServiceAccount, not the user's identity. See `[sre_agent/mcp_client.py](../sre_agent/mcp_client.py)`.
3. **Remaining code quality items** — `as Unknown as` type casts, silent catches in edge paths, and view test coverage gaps.
4. **Toast tier system refinement** — Error/warning/info toasts need consistent visual treatment and auto-dismiss behavior.

### Medium-Term (Months)

1. **Multi-cluster topology** — The topology graph (see `[sre_agent/dependency_graph.py](../sre_agent/dependency_graph.py)`) currently shows a single cluster. With ACM integration, we could show cross-cluster dependencies — a service in cluster A depends on a database in cluster B.
2. **Runbook execution** — The 10 built-in runbooks (see `[sre_agent/runbooks.py](../sre_agent/runbooks.py)`) are injected into the system prompt as text. They could become executable workflows — step-by-step investigation plans with checkpoints and rollback, extending the plan runtime (`[sre_agent/plan_runtime.py](../sre_agent/plan_runtime.py)`).
3. **Natural language alerting rules** — "Alert me when any namespace uses more than 80% of its CPU quota" should create a real PrometheusRule, not just a monitor finding.
4. **Collaborative incident response** — Multiple users claiming and working on the same incident view. Real-time cursor presence, shared investigation state, handoff annotations. The ViewEventBus (`[sre_agent/api/view_events.py](../sre_agent/api/view_events.py)`) already supports multi-user events.
5. **Cost intelligence** — Beyond Vertex AI cost tracking: correlate cluster resource costs (node hours, PVC storage, egress) with workload owners. "This namespace costs $847/month and 60% of that is unused memory requests."
6. **Drift detection** — Compare live cluster state against a golden baseline (Git-stored manifests, policy-as-code). Surface drift as inbox items (`[sre_agent/inbox.py](../sre_agent/inbox.py)`) with one-click remediation.

### Long-Term (Vision)

1. **Voice-first SRE** — The [design principles](../DESIGN_PRINCIPLES.md) say "conversational-first." The next step is literal voice interaction — describe a problem verbally, get a diagnosis and fix proposal. Useful for on-call scenarios where you're on your phone at 3am.
2. **Predictive capacity with ML** — The 4 trend scanners (see `[sre_agent/trend_scanners.py](../sre_agent/trend_scanners.py)`) use `predict_linear()` for simple extrapolation. Real ML models could learn seasonal patterns, workload correlations, and predict capacity needs weeks out.
3. **Self-healing clusters** — The auto-fix system (see [autonomous remediation spec](superpowers/specs/2026-04-17-autonomous-remediation-design.md)) currently handles individual pod/deployment issues. A self-healing cluster would handle infrastructure-level problems: scaling node pools before predicted capacity shortfalls, rebalancing workloads across availability zones, and coordinating rolling updates with zero user intervention.
4. **Plugin ecosystem** — Skills are already drop-in `.md` files (see [SKILL_DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md](SKILL_DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md)). The next step is a skill marketplace where teams can share and discover skills — "install the Kafka SRE skill" or "install the GPU cluster management skill." The scaffolder (`[sre_agent/skill_scaffolder.py](../sre_agent/skill_scaffolder.py)`) already generates skills from usage patterns.
5. **Compliance-as-conversation** — "Are we SOC 2 compliant?" should produce a real-time audit with evidence links, gap analysis, and remediation suggestions. The security scanner (`[sre_agent/security_tools.py](../sre_agent/security_tools.py)`) already has the primitives; it needs a compliance framework layer.

## Final Thoughts

Pulse started as a cluster browser and became an AI SRE platform in 47 days. The velocity was real but so were the mistakes — silent failures, CSS wars, Helm gotchas, and prompt engineering dead-ends. Every mistake became a memory file, every memory file prevented a repeat.

The most important design decision wasn't any single technical choice. It was the feedback loop: build -> deploy -> discover bugs on a real cluster -> write a memory -> never make that mistake again. The project improved not just in features but in the *process* of building features.

The codebase today is 2,184 backend tests, 1,942 frontend tests, 16 eval suites, 175 scenarios, and 35 memory files. But the real output isn't the code — it's the confidence that when a cluster page tells you something is wrong, the agent actually knows what to do about it.

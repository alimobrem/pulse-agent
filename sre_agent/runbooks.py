"""Built-in runbooks for common Kubernetes failure patterns.

These are injected into the agent's system prompt so it can follow
structured diagnostic procedures when encountering known issues.

RUNBOOK_CHUNKS is a dict keyed by pattern name for selective injection.
select_runbooks() picks the most relevant runbooks based on user query.
RUNBOOKS is the full concatenation kept for backward compatibility.

## [2.3.0] - 2026-04-14

### ORCA UI Surfaces
- **Postmortems tab** — Auto-generated postmortem reports with timeline, root cause, blast radius, and prevention recommendations in the Incident Center.
- **Topology view** — Dependency graph visualization with blast radius analysis at `/topology` (Impact Analysis).
- **Plans tab** — View, edit, and delete investigation plan templates from the Toolbox Skills section.
- **SLOs tab** — CRUD for SLO definitions with live Prometheus burn-rate queries (`GET /slo`, `POST /slo`, `DELETE /slo/{service}/{slo_type}`).

### Analytics Restructured
- **Agent Intelligence section** — Unified analytics view with routing decisions, fix strategies, and learning feed.
- **Fix strategy effectiveness** — `GET /analytics/fix-strategies` shows per-category+tool success rates.
- **Learning feed** — `GET /analytics/learning` surfaces weight updates, scaffolded skills, and routing decisions.

### Unified Routing
- **Orchestrator delegates to ORCA selector** — ~200 lines of duplicate keyword routing removed from `orchestrator.py`. The ORCA 5-channel selector is now the single routing authority.

### Unified Layout Engine
- **Backend-authoritative layout** — Layout engine now owns all positioning with optional frontend hint support. Eliminates layout drift between backend generation and frontend rendering.

### Plan CRUD
- **Plan template management** — `PUT /plan-templates/{type}` and `DELETE /plan-templates/{type}` endpoints for editing and deleting plan templates from the UI.

### SLO Management
- **SLO registry** — `slo_registry.py` provides CRUD operations with live Prometheus burn-rate integration. Persisted to `slo_definitions` table (migration 016).

### Skill Enrichment
- **All skills have trigger_patterns, tool_sequences, investigation_framework** — Every built-in skill now declares regex trigger patterns, named tool sequences for phased execution, and structured investigation methodology.

### Live Investigation Phases
- **`investigation_progress` WebSocket event** — Real-time phase updates during multi-phase investigations. Each phase reports status (pending/running/complete/failed/skipped), skill name, summary, and confidence.

### Deploy Risk Badges
- **Change risk scoring** — `change_risk.py` correlates recent changes with incidents. Findings display deploy risk badges in the UI.

### Skill Badges
- **Tool catalog badges** — Tools in the catalog show which skill(s) they belong to.

### Node Dedup in Dependency Graph
- **Topology deduplication** — Duplicate nodes in the dependency graph are merged, reducing visual noise in large clusters.

### Tool Renames
- **`describe_agent` / `describe_tools`** — Self-description tools renamed for clarity (previously `self_describe` / `self_describe_tools`).

### Code Review Fixes
- **Crash bug** — Fixed null pointer in plan runtime when investigation has no phases.
- **SQL precedence** — Fixed operator precedence in selector learning weight query.
- **Duplicate computation** — Eliminated redundant burn-rate calculation in SLO status endpoint.
- **O(n^2) BFS** — Fixed quadratic performance in dependency graph traversal.

### New Key Files
- `slo_registry.py` — SLO definition CRUD with live Prometheus burn rates
- `change_risk.py` — Deploy risk scoring for findings
- `plan_runtime.py` — Phased investigation plan execution engine
- `skill_scaffolder.py` — AI-generated skill packages from usage patterns
- `selector_learning.py` — ORCA selector weight learning from feedback signals

## v2.2.0 (2026-04-12)

### Adaptive Tool Selection Engine
- **TF-IDF Prediction** — Learns which tools are relevant for each query from real usage. Tokenizes queries into unigrams + bigrams, scores against `tool_predictions` table, returns top-K tools. Zero cost, sub-millisecond.
- **LLM Fallback** — When TF-IDF confidence is low (cold start), Haiku picks tools from names only (~200 tokens). Selections feed back into TF-IDF dictionary, making the LLM path self-eliminating.
- **Co-occurrence Bundles** — Tracks tools called together in the same turn (`tool_cooccurrence` table). When a tool is predicted, its co-occurring tools are automatically included.
- **Negative Signals** — Tools offered but never called get `miss_count` increments, actively suppressing wasted tools via `score - miss_count * 0.3`.
- **Mid-Turn Chain Expansion** — After each tool call, chain bigrams and co-occurrence data dynamically add predicted next-tools to the available set.
- **Daily Score Decay** — Scores multiplied by 0.95 daily, entries not seen in 30 days pruned. Prevents stale patterns from dominating.
- **ALWAYS_INCLUDE trimmed** — Reduced from 12 to 5 essential tools (list_pods, get_events, namespace_summary, record_audit_entry, list_my_skills).
- **Minimum set size** — Enforces at least 8 tools per query, padding from category fallback if needed.
- **New tables** — `tool_predictions` and `tool_cooccurrence` (migration 012).

### Pre-Route Handoff
- **Skill classifier checks handoff rules during routing** — If the keyword winner's `handoff_to` rules match the query, routes directly to the handoff target instead of routing to the winner first. Fixes queries like "create a capacity planning dashboard" routing to capacity_planner instead of view_designer.

### Type Safety
- **Typed `beta_tool` wrapper** — Created `sre_agent/decorators.py` with a properly-typed wrapper around `anthropic.beta_tool`. All 21 tool files import from `decorators` instead of `anthropic` directly. Single `type: ignore` in one file replaces 40+ across the codebase.
- **ToolLike Protocol** — Added `ToolLike` protocol to `tool_registry.py` for proper typing of tool object collections.
- **Mypy clean** — 0 errors across 115 source files with proper type annotations (no `type: ignore` in tool files).
- **Ruff clean** — 0 lint errors.

### Eval Improvements
- **Error suite fixed** — `completed: true` for error-handling scenarios, `should_block_release: false` for all 5 error scenarios.
- **Adversarial suite fixed** — `adversarial_resource_exhaustion` changed to `should_block_release: false` (agent correctly mitigated, not refused).
- **Synonym expansion** — Added "forbidden"/"exceeded" as synonyms for "quota" in replay scoring.
- **Error display** — Replay CLI now shows error messages in text output instead of silently swallowing exceptions.
- **All 9 eval suites pass** — 70/70 scenarios green.

## v1.15.0 (2026-04-09)

### Added
- **Modular package architecture** — Split 3 largest files into focused packages: `k8s_tools/` (11 modules, was 4419 lines), `monitor/` (10 modules, was 2486 lines), `api/` (12 modules, was 2415 lines). No file exceeds 910 lines. All backward-compatible imports preserved.
- **Typo auto-correction** — `fix_typos()` corrects ~130 common K8s/SRE misspellings (deployment, namespace, prometheus, vulnerability, etc.) with automatic plural/suffix handling. Applied before intent classification and tool selection.
- **Route safety tests** — 22 tests guard against broken GVR routes (leading tilde, wrong namespace wildcard, double slashes in API paths).
- **Centralized configuration** — All ~30 raw `os.environ.get()` calls migrated to `get_settings()`. Added 6 missing config fields: `db_pool_min/max`, `noise_threshold`, `max_trust_level`, `investigations_max_per_scan`, `investigation_cooldown`, `dev_user`.

### Removed
- **`layout_templates.py`** — deleted deprecated module (replaced by `layout_engine.py`), along with 4 backward-compat tests.
- **Dead code** — removed unused `DEFAULT_DB_PATH` constant, identity typo mapping, unused `os` imports from 4 files.

### Fixed
- **Nodes page 404** — `TopologyMap.tsx` used `/r/~v1~nodes/*` which decoded to empty API group (`/apis//v1/nodes`). Fixed to `/r/v1~nodes/_`.
- **CRDs route bug** — `CRDsView.tsx` produced leading tilde for CRDs with empty `spec.group`.
- **`MAX_RESULTS` duplication** — was defined identically in 8 k8s_tools submodules; centralized to `validators.py`.

## v1.14.0 (2026-04-03)

### Added
- **Tool eval prompts** -- 84 real-world user queries mapped to expected tool calls, covering all 82 registered tools. CI enforces eval prompt coverage for new tools.
- **`delete_dashboard` and `clone_dashboard` tools** -- manage saved views from the agent conversation.
- **Token usage tracking** -- records input/output/cache tokens per turn from the Claude API for cost visibility.
- **Semantic layout engine** -- role-based auto-layout replaces 5 fixed dashboard templates. Widgets arranged by role (KPI, chart, table, status) and content relationships.
- **Intelligence loop** -- `intelligence.py` feeds tool analytics (query reliability, dashboard patterns, error hotspots) back into the system prompt.
- **Plan validation** -- `plan_dashboard` now validates plans before execution, catching missing components early.
- **Tool analytics** -- full audit log with chain intelligence (bigram discovery, next-tool hints), usage stats API, chains endpoint.
- **View versioning** -- version history with undo support for saved views.

### Changed
- **Prompt optimization** -- SRE system prompt reduced from 28KB to 8KB (71% reduction) via selective component schema and runbook injection.
- **View designer prompt** rewritten -- 50% smaller, workflow-first approach.
- `verify_query` made optional for recipe-based PromQL queries to reduce Prometheus round-trips.
- `time_range` defaults to 1h for chart components.

### Fixed

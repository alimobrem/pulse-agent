AI-powered OpenShift/Kubernetes SRE and Security Agent built on Claude. Pulse Agent connects to your cluster via the Kubernetes API and uses Claude Opus for diagnostics, incident triage, security audits, and automated remediation -- all through natural language. It pairs with the [OpenShift Pulse](https://github.com/alimobrem/OpenshiftPulse) UI for rich incident management, or runs standalone as a CLI.

**Docs:** [API Contract](API_CONTRACT.md) | [Architecture](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) | [Database](DATABASE.md) | [Security](SECURITY.md) | [Design Principles](DESIGN_PRINCIPLES.md) | [Testing & Evals](TESTING.md) | [Skill Developer Guide](docs/SKILL_DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md) | [Contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md) | [Changelog](CHANGELOG.md)

## Agent Intelligence (ORCA)

Pulse Agent uses the ORCA (Orchestrated Routing & Classification Architecture) system to route every user query to the right skill with the right tools. This replaces keyword-only routing with multi-signal intelligence.

### Skill Selector (6 channels)

Every incoming query is scored by 6 independent channels. Scores are fused with learned weights and re-ranked:

| Channel | Signal | Weight |
|---------|--------|--------|
| **Keyword** | Skill keyword index (longest-match-first) | 0.30 |
| **Component** | K8s resource types extracted from query (Pod, Deployment, Service, etc.) matched to skill categories | 0.20 |
| **Historical** | Token co-occurrence from past successful skill usages (from `skill_usage` table) | 0.20 |
| **Semantic** | TF-IDF cosine similarity between query and skill descriptions/keywords | 0.15 |
| **Taxonomy** | Alert name prefixes and scanner category matching | 0.10 |
| **Temporal** | Recent-change keywords ("just deployed", "after upgrade") boost operations skills | 0.05 |

Weights are not static -- they are **recomputed from outcomes** via `selector_learning.py`. The system analyzes `skill_selection_log` entries (correct selections vs. overrides) and adjusts channel weights to optimize routing accuracy. Learned weights persist to the database.

### Phased Plan Execution

Complex incidents are resolved through multi-phase plans that progress through stages:

**Triage** -- Identify the problem scope and severity.
**Diagnose** -- Investigate root cause with evidence gathering.
**Remediate** -- Apply fixes (with confirmation gates for write operations).
**Verify** -- Confirm the fix resolved the issue.
**Postmortem** -- Auto-generate a structured incident report.

### Plan Templates

10 built-in plan templates cover the most common incident types:

| Template | Scanner Category | Phases |
|----------|-----------------|--------|
| `crashloop-resolution` | `crashloop` | triage, diagnose, remediate, verify |
| `oom-investigation` | `oom` | triage, diagnose, remediate, verify |
| `node-pressure` | `nodes` | triage, node_diagnostics, drain_cordon, verify |
| `deployment-failure` | `workloads` | triage, change_analysis, rollback_decision, verify |
| `image-pull-error` | `image_pull` | triage, diagnose, remediate, verify |
| `scheduling-failure` | `scheduling` | triage, diagnose, remediate, verify |
| `cert-expiry` | `cert_expiry` | triage, diagnose, verify |
| `operator-degraded` | `operators` | triage, diagnose, verify |
| `security-incident` | `security` | triage, diagnose, remediate, verify |
| `latency-degradation` | `latency` | triage, diagnose, remediate, verify |

When no template matches, the plan builder skill dynamically constructs a plan from the query context.

### Supporting Systems

- **Dependency Graph** -- Live in-memory graph of K8s resources (Pods, Deployments, Services, PVCs, ConfigMaps) connected by ownerReferences, selectors, and volume mounts. Used for blast radius calculation and topology-aware routing.
- **SLO Registry** -- Per-service SLO/SLI tracking with error budget calculation and burn rate alerting. The monitor includes a dedicated SLO burn rate scanner. SLO alerts feed into the skill selector.
- **Change Risk Scoring** -- Pre-deploy risk assessment that analyzes image changes, resource modifications, historical failure rates, time-of-day risk, and blast radius from the dependency graph. Returns a 0-100 risk score with human-readable factors.
- **Auto-Postmortem** -- After plan execution completes, the postmortem skill auto-generates a structured report: timeline, root cause, contributing factors, blast radius, actions taken, and prevention recommendations.
- **Skill Scaffolding** -- When a novel incident (no matching template) is resolved, the system auto-drafts a new `skill.md` with trigger patterns, tool sequences, and investigation framework extracted from the resolution. Stored as `generated_by="auto", reviewed=false` and surfaced in the Toolbox UI for review.

## Skills

7 skills loaded at startup from `sre_agent/skills/`. Each skill is a self-contained directory with `skill.md` (prompt + frontmatter), `evals.yaml` (test scenarios), and optional `components.yaml` or `mcp.yaml`.

| Skill | Description | Categories | Write Access |
|-------|-------------|------------|:------------:|
| **sre** | Cluster diagnostics, incident triage, resource management | diagnostics, workloads, networking, storage, monitoring, operations, gitops | Yes |
| **security** | Security scanning, RBAC analysis, compliance checks | security, networking | No |
| **view_designer** | Dashboard creation and component design | (all tools) | No |
| **capacity_planner** | Capacity analysis, resource forecasting, scaling recommendations | diagnostics, monitoring, workloads | No |
| **plan_builder** | Investigation plans and custom skill creation | diagnostics, workloads, monitoring, operations | Yes |
| **postmortem** | Auto-generates structured postmortem reports from incident data | diagnostics | No |
| **slo_management** | SLO/SLI tracking, error budget analysis, burn rate alerting | monitoring, diagnostics | No |

Skills support handoff: the SRE skill hands off to `security` when it detects scan/RBAC keywords, and to `view_designer` for dashboard requests. User-created skills can be added at runtime without restarting the agent.

See [docs/SKILL_DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md](docs/SKILL_DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md) for creating new skills.

## Features

### SRE Agent

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.12+**
- **Access to a Kubernetes or OpenShift cluster** (`oc login` or valid `~/.kube/config`)
- **Claude API access** via Anthropic API key or Google Vertex AI project
- **PostgreSQL 14+** for data persistence (optional for basic CLI use, required for memory/monitor/views)

### Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/alimobrem/pulse-agent.git
cd pulse-agent
pip install -e .
```

### Configure API Access

Pick one:

```bash
# Option A: Vertex AI
export ANTHROPIC_VERTEX_PROJECT_ID=your-gcp-project
export CLOUD_ML_REGION=us-east5
gcloud auth application-default login

# Option B: Anthropic API
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
```

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `ANTHROPIC_VERTEX_PROJECT_ID` | GCP project for Vertex AI | required* |
| `CLOUD_ML_REGION` | GCP region | required* |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | Direct Anthropic API key | required* |
| `PULSE_AGENT_MODEL` | Claude model | `claude-opus-4-6` |
| `PULSE_AGENT_DATABASE_URL` | PostgreSQL connection URL | required for full features |
| `PULSE_AGENT_MEMORY` | Enable self-improving memory | `1` (enabled) |
| `PULSE_AGENT_AUTOFIX_ENABLED` | Enable monitor auto-fix | `true` |
| `PULSE_AGENT_MAX_TRUST_LEVEL` | Server-side max trust level (0-4) | `3` |
| `PULSE_AGENT_SCAN_INTERVAL` | Monitor scan interval (seconds) | `60` |
| `PULSE_AGENT_WS_TOKEN` | WebSocket auth token | auto-generated |
| `PULSE_AGENT_HARNESS` | Enable tool selection optimizations | `1` (enabled) |

*One of Vertex AI or Anthropic API key is required.

### Run

```bash
# SRE agent (CLI)
python -m sre_agent.main

# Security scanner (CLI)
python -m sre_agent.main security

# API server (WebSocket + REST, port 8080)
pulse-agent-api
```

### PostgreSQL Setup (Local Development)

For full features (memory, views, tool analytics, SLOs), you need a PostgreSQL instance. The simplest local setup:

```bash
podman run -d --name pulse-pg \
  -p 5433:5432 \
  -e POSTGRES_USER=pulse \
  -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=pulse \
  -e POSTGRES_DB=pulse_test \
  postgres:16-alpine

export PULSE_AGENT_DATABASE_URL=postgresql://pulse:pulse@localhost:5433/pulse_test
```

Schema migrations (currently at v016) are applied automatically on startup.

## Deploy to OpenShift

### Recommended: Unified Deploy

The deploy script in the UI repo builds both images, pushes to your container registry, and runs Helm upgrade:

```bash
# Prerequisites
oc login https://api.your-cluster:6443
podman login quay.io  # or your registry

# Clone both repos
git clone https://github.com/alimobrem/pulse-agent.git
git clone https://github.com/alimobrem/OpenshiftPulse.git

# Deploy everything (UI + Agent)
cd OpenshiftPulse
./deploy/deploy.sh
```

What `deploy.sh` does:
1. Builds the React/TypeScript UI with rspack
2. Builds Agent and UI container images in parallel with Podman
3. Pushes both images to Quay.io (or your configured registry)
4. Runs `helm upgrade` with the umbrella chart (agent deploys first, UI reads the auto-generated WS token)

Useful flags:
```bash
./deploy/deploy.sh --dry-run           # Preview without applying
./deploy/deploy.sh --skip-build        # Redeploy with existing images
./deploy/deploy.sh --set agent.mcp.enabled=true  # Deploy with MCP enabled
```

### Helm Values

Key values to configure:

| Value | Description | Default |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| `vertexAI.projectId` | GCP project (required if using Vertex AI) | -- |
| `anthropicApiKey.existingSecret` | K8s Secret with Anthropic API key | -- |
| `rbac.allowWriteOperations` | Enable scale, restart, cordon, delete, apply | `false` |
| `rbac.allowSecretAccess` | Enable secret scanning | `false` |
| `mcp.enabled` | Deploy OpenShift MCP server sidecar | `true` |
| `memory.enabled` | Enable self-improving agent memory | `true` |

The chart requires either `vertexAI.projectId` or `anthropicApiKey.existingSecret`. Install will fail with a clear error if neither is set. The WebSocket auth token is auto-generated as a Kubernetes Secret on first install.

### Container Security

- Non-root user (UID 1001) on RHEL UBI9 base image
- `runAsNonRoot`, `readOnlyRootFilesystem`, drops all capabilities
- NetworkPolicy restricts egress to DNS + HTTPS only
- Liveness/readiness probes via `/healthz`

## UI (OpenShift Pulse)

The [OpenShift Pulse](https://github.com/alimobrem/OpenshiftPulse) frontend is a React/TypeScript application that connects to the agent via WebSocket. Key surfaces:

### Incident Center
6 tabs for full incident lifecycle management:

| Tab | What it shows |
|-----|---------------|
| **Active** | Live findings from the monitor with severity, confidence, and auto-fix controls |
| **Timeline** | Chronological event stream across all scanners |
| **Review Queue** | Proposed actions awaiting human approval (trust level 2) |
| **Postmortems** | Auto-generated postmortem reports from resolved incidents |
| **History** | All past findings and actions with rollback support |
| **Alerts** | Prometheus firing alerts with investigation links |

### Impact Analysis (`/topology`)
Live dependency graph visualization showing resource relationships, blast radius overlays, and change risk scores.

### Toolbox
Consolidated management page with 8 tabs:

| Tab | Purpose |
|-----|---------|
| **Catalog** | All 122 tools organized by agent and category |
| **Skills** | 7 loaded skills with status, keywords, and handoff configuration |
| **Plans** | Plan templates and active plan executions |
| **SLOs** | SLO registry, error budgets, and burn rate status |
| **Connections** | MCP server connections and toolset toggles |
| **Components** | Component type catalog with rendering examples |
| **Usage** | Paginated tool invocation audit log |
| **Analytics** | Top tools, chain patterns, routing accuracy, token efficiency |

### Other Surfaces
- **Mission Control** -- Real-time cluster overview with trust level slider
- **Custom Dashboards** -- User-scoped generative dashboards with share/clone support

## Testing

```bash
pip install -e '.[test]'
python3 -m pytest tests/ -v           # Full test suite
python3 -m pytest tests/test_foo.py   # Single file
make verify                           # Lint + type-check + tests
```

All tests run without a live cluster or API key (fully mocked). See [TESTING.md](TESTING.md) for test conventions, fixtures, and coverage targets.

### Eval Framework

11 eval suites with 98 scenarios for release gating and regression detection:

| Suite | Scenarios | Purpose |
|-------|:---------:|---------|
| `release` | 12 | Primary CI gate (must pass) |
| `selector` | 23 | Skill routing accuracy |
| `sysadmin` | 20 | Real-world sysadmin queries |
| `view_designer` | 7 | Dashboard generation quality |
| `core` | 6 | Mixed baseline coverage |
| `integration` | 7 | Reliability and failure modes |
| `adversarial` | 5 | Prompt injection and edge cases |
| `errors` | 5 | Error handling and recovery |
| `fleet` | 5 | Multi-cluster operations |
| `autofix` | 5 | Auto-fix decision accuracy |
| `safety` | 3 | Safety and compliance checks |

```bash
python -m sre_agent.evals.cli --suite release --fail-on-gate   # CI gate
python -m sre_agent.evals.cli --suite core --save-baseline     # Save baseline
python -m sre_agent.evals.cli --suite core --compare-baseline  # Regression check
```

Current release gate average: **98.1%**.
